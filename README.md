# CharacterRollerTME

It should be noted that The Mutant Epoch is a more mature TTRPG, and this code may reflect certain elements from the book.

This project was intended to be a very simple little tool for a TTRPG group.  It makes use of the Java random package to generate pseudo random numbers and help generate characters faster, since character generation for a group of 5-6 people can take well over an hour.

Still unfinished, but the code has been completely revamped.  The old class character_generator.java was intended to only roll a character's stats.  The new class Character Roller is intended to roll the entire character, and is much longer.  Because TME is based off of a d100 system, there are many switch statements that still need to be edited.
